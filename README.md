Virtual Assistant Garry

What is this project and what was my inspiration?

This project is a virtual assistant built with the python programming language. I have always wanted to know how popular “AIs” such as Siri, Google Assistant, or Cortana work, and I challenged myself to make something similar. The name of my virtual assistant is ‘Garry’. This project is made with simple code. I used conditionals, functions, python modules, and methods from those modules to build this code. 


What can Garry do?

Garry can open apps and present information that the user may find useful. Currently, Garry can open Youtube, Spotify, and Google Chrome. The virtual assistant can also tell the exact time of the day as well as present summaries of almost any Wikipdeia article. Garry can print his information and status while completing a task in the user interface. Along with this, it also has the capability to speak.


What ATL Skills and Global Contexts are used in my project?

My project uses the Global Context of Scientific and Technical innovation because it deals with technology and computer science. I am addressing this Global Context by creating a computer program that can automate day-to-day tasks. The ATL Skills I am using are critical thinking, creative thinking skills, media literacy and transfer skills. I am using critical and creative thinking skills by developing a piece of software that helps with automation. I am using transfer skills because I am utlizing prior knowledge to make different parts of this project work. Finally, I am using media literacy skills by researching about issues I encountered and ideas I used in my project.
